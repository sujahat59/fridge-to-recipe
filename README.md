# Fridge to Recipe 

This is a project I made to learn how to build a real web app, using Html, Css, and javaScript.

## What the app exactly does
You can search for recipes by typing ingredients you already have (like "eggs, milk, cheese") and it shows recipes using Spoonacular API. You can also:
- Get random recipe suggestions
- Save your favorite recipes to localStorage
- Browse saved recipes later

## What Things I learned
- How to fetch data using JavaScript (async/await)
- How to use an external API (Spoonacular)
- How to use localStorage to save user data
- Styling with CSS (also learned how to make it look modern ðŸ˜„)
- Making it responsive so it works on both Mac and mobile

## Things I still need to improve
- Better error messages
- Add some loading animation
- Maybe connect to a real backend later (just used localStorage now)
- learning about databases more in depth
- maybe some real user...

This project helped me understand how front-end and real APIs work together. Iâ€™m still learning but feeling more confident with every project ðŸ’ª
